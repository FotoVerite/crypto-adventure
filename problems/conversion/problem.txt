Okay now that we have a basic understanding of how to convert utf-8 strings to binary arrays. We can use substacks robust utf8-bytes module for now on. Just install by npm utf8-bytes

You will again be given UTF-8 formated text as an array of arguments. Output it as hex, Base64 and then as UTF8. Remember buffers can have lots of encodings.
